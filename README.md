# Portfolio
I hold a Bcomm Accounting degree from the University of Cape Town (UCT) as well as a PGDip in Digital Business from Wits Business School. My experience is grounded in finance specific to the development industry both (national and local areas) and international. In addition, I completed the Social Entrepreneurship programme from GIBS to foster my entrepreneurship foundation within the digital era.  I also have completed s a Data Science qualification of which I am not venturing into gaining more experience in especially with a keen interest in Machine Learning.  Going forward, with my successful completion in the Data Science programme from Hyperion Dev, my goal is to specialise in visualising Big Data within the development industry as well as projects that require unearthing knowledge that is hidden in the data haystack
